#Baby Website

The project is currently being built off of the develop branch.

I am currently using a MongoDB backend with VueJS that is statically served with Netlify. I plan to build out a middle tier using AWS Lambda and API Gateway in the future to increase security and also not having to send the logic to the front end.

I also plan to build this out further into a personal blog to announce more life updates or potentially write about things I learn in my studies.
